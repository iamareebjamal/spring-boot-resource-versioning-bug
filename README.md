### Resource Versioning - Content Mode

> Bug Sample Repo

This is a bare https://start.spring.io project created with Boot 2.0.6 and 
- web starter
- thymeleaf starter
- actuator starter

`application.yaml` contains basic config to enable content versioning strategy but is not working

As soon as actuator starter dependency is commented out, it starts working again
